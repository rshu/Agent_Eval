**Problem Statement:**
Design and implement a **UUID v7 generator**, referencing the style/approach used by existing versions (e.g., v1, v4). Integrate the UUID v7 generator into the **`IdUtil`** utility class so it can be used similarly to other ID/UUID helpers.

Additionally, extend the unit tests in **`IdUtilTest`** to cover UUID v7, including:

* Validating UUID v7 properties (e.g., correct **version** and **variant**).
* Testing UUID v7 **uniqueness**, **monotonicity** (ordering behavior), and **performance** (basic performance check / benchmark-style test as appropriate for unit tests).

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
