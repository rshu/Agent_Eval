**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the bug described in the PR and ensure it is tested.

**Repo Link:**
[https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

**Problem Statement:**
Fix a Python argument-parsing issue where some tensor APIs accept invalid extra positional arguments (especially when the first argument is a tuple/list). Add regression tests so invalid calls raise errors instead of silently doing the wrong thing.

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
