**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the argument-parsing bug described in the PR, focusing on the relevant files listed below, and add/adjust tests to prevent regressions.

**Repo Link:**

**Problem Statement:**
Some tensor methods that take **one “integer sequence” argument** (i.e., they accept either a single sequence like a tuple/list, or varargs like `*args`) have a bug: **if multiple positional arguments are passed and the first one is a sequence, extra arguments may be silently ignored** rather than raising an error. This can create silent bugs (e.g., a developer passes an extra positional argument expecting it to have an effect, but it is ignored).

Update the underlying argument parsing logic so that **tuple/sequence-style arguments do not tolerate extra positional arguments** for APIs that are intended to accept exactly one integer-sequence argument. The fix should apply broadly to relevant methods (not just `reshape`, but other similar APIs such as `view`, `tile`, etc.).

Add or update unit tests to ensure that passing extra positional arguments in these cases **raises an error** (e.g., `TypeError`) rather than silently proceeding.

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `torch/csrc/utils/python_arg_parser.cpp` (core PythonArgParser behavior) 
* `test/test_view_ops.py` (tests for view/reshape-style ops; add regression cases)
* `test/test_torch.py` (tests for general torch API argument parsing; add regression coverage as needed) 

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
