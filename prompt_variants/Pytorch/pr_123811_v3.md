**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the reported **torch.compile / Inductor recompilation bug**, focusing on the relevant files listed below, and add/adjust tests.

**Repo Link:**
[https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) 

**Problem Statement:**
When compiling a function with `torch.compile(..., dynamic=True)`, the compiled function **recompiles every time** for inputs of different sequence lengths, even though dynamic shapes are expected to avoid recompilation in this pattern. A minimal repro is:

* `L` is derived from `x.shape`
* the function creates a tensor using `torch.full((L, L), ...)`
* calling the compiled function with `(2, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, `(2, 5)` triggers recompiles (observable via `TORCH_LOGS="recompiles"`). 

Fix the underlying cause in the compilation/guarding pathway so that this dynamic-shape pattern does **not** recompile unnecessarily (or only recompiles when genuinely required). Ensure the behavior matches expectations for dynamic compilation and does not introduce regressions.


**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `torch/_dynamo/` (guarding / graph capture behaviors related to dynamic shapes and recompilation)
* `torch/_inductor/` (Inductor lowering / specialization decisions that may trigger recompiles)
* `torch/_ops.py` or relevant operator-dispatch glue (operator overload/schema handling implicated by dynamic-size arguments)
* `test/inductor/` and/or `test/dynamo/` (add a regression test that checks recompilation behavior with `TORCH_LOGS="recompiles"` or equivalent internal counters)

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
