**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix/implement the requested change in the repository based on the PR issue description.

**Problem Statement:**
The existing JavaScript test suite for the HiAppEvent module is unreliable and fails in environments where the API and runtime expectations differ from what the tests assume. The tests import the HiAppEvent package using an outdated module name/casing, causing the suite to break on platforms where module resolution is case-sensitive. Several cases also misuse the HiAppEvent.write interface by passing key/value varargs or relying on synchronous assertions without properly waiting for asynchronous callbacks, leading to false positives, false negatives, or tests that finish before assertions run. Additionally, the test runtime lacks required async/await support (regeneratorRuntime), which can cause async test cases to throw at startup. The test suite should correctly exercise success and error paths (e.g., invalid/empty event names) with deterministic assertions that run after the callback completes.

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `hiviewdfx/hiappeventtest/hiappeventjstest/src/main/js/default/pages/index/index.js`
* `hiviewdfx/hiappeventtest/hiappeventjstest/src/main/js/default/test/HiAppEvent.test.js`

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
