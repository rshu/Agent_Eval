**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix/implement the requested change in the repository based on the PR issue description.

**Problem Statement:**
The current JavaScript test suite for the HiAppEvent module is unreliable and does not reflect the actual API behavior. Tests import the module using an incorrect package name/casing, causing failures in environments where module resolution is case-sensitive. Several cases invoke `HiAppEvent.write` using an outdated argument format and treat the operation as synchronous, so assertions can run before callbacks fire, leading to flaky or false-positive results. Error scenarios such as empty or excessively long event names are also asserted incorrectly, not matching the expected error codes/return values from the API. The tests need to consistently validate success and failure paths based on the callback results and complete asynchronously so they accurately verify HiAppEvent behavior.

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `hiviewdfx/hiappeventtest/hiappeventjstest/src/main/js/default/pages/index/index.js`
* `hiviewdfx/hiappeventtest/hiappeventjstest/src/main/js/default/test/HiAppEvent.test.js`

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
