**Problem Statement:**
This issue reports that the JavaScript tests for a module are flaky and don’t match the real API behavior due to incorrect imports and outdated, synchronous assumptions. It requests updating the tests to use the correct module reference and to validate success and error cases through proper asynchronous callback handling.

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
