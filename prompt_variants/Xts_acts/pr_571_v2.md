**Problem Statement:**
This issue reports that the JavaScript tests for an event-logging module are flaky and fail across different environments due to incorrect imports and improper handling of asynchronous behavior. It asks to update the tests to use the correct module reference, call the API correctly, ensure async support, and add reliable assertions for both success and error cases.

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
