**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix/implement the requested change in the repository based on the PR issue description.

**Repo Link:**

**Problem Statement:**
The existing HiAppEvent JS test suite is unreliable and does not reflect the current HiAppEvent API behavior. Tests import the module using an outdated/incorrect package name, causing failures before any assertions run. Several test cases also misuse asynchronous callbacks (not signaling test completion) and make assertions that can pass or fail nondeterministically because they don’t wait for the callback result. In addition, some write API calls use an obsolete parameter format and the negative-input scenarios (such as empty or overly long event names) do not verify the expected error outcomes. The test coverage needs to accurately validate successful writes across event types and data types, and correctly assert error codes for invalid inputs.

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `hiviewdfx/hiappeventtest/hiappeventjstest/src/main/js/default/pages/index/index.js`
* `hiviewdfx/hiappeventtest/hiappeventjstest/src/main/js/default/test/HiAppEvent.test.js`

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
