**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the reported **accuracy bug** in MindSpore’s auto-parallel static-graph execution involving FlashAttentionScore, and add/adjust tests to prevent regressions.

**Problem Statement:**
This is a **/kind bug** PR. 
In **static-graph auto-parallel** training, when using **FlashAttentionScore** in **TND mode** under a **TND + CP** scenario, splitting along the **query sequence dimension** can lead to an **accuracy issue** if the input data is **not segmented** (i.e., not chunked/partitioned as expected). The goal is to fix the accuracy mismatch so that results remain within expected error bounds and align with single-card behavior. 

Add or update coverage to validate the scenario described in the PR: FlashAttentionScore (TND), query-seq split in auto-parallel, and unsegmented input data; verify correctness against single-card / expected reference behavior. 

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
