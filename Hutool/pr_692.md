## Prompt v1 — Original PR Issue Description

**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Implement the requested refactor and test updates described in the PR issue.

**Repo Link:**
[https://gitee.com/chinabugotech/hutool](https://gitee.com/chinabugotech/hutool) 

**Problem Statement:**
Update the codebase so that **`PredicateUtil` is implemented using `StreamUtil`** (i.e., refactor/rewire logic to reuse Stream utilities rather than duplicating stream-handling behavior). 

Additionally:

* **Complete/expand unit tests** for the affected functionality (add missing test coverage and ensure tests validate expected behavior).
* **Suppress generic-parameter warnings** where appropriate (e.g., address compiler warnings related to raw types / unchecked generics in a minimal and idiomatic way).

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.

* `hutool-core/src/main/java/**/core/stream/StreamUtil.java`
