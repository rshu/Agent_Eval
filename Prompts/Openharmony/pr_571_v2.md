**Problem Statement:**
This issue reports a regression in how the DLP permission service serializes and parses general info, causing the certificate size value and an offline access flag to be read or validated incorrectly and break interoperability. It requests fixing the encoding/validation so values round-trip reliably and adding unit tests to cover valid and invalid inputs.

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
