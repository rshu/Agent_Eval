**Problem Statement:**
The DLP permission service’s general-info serialization/deserialization has regressed around the `certSize` field after a previous “cert_size optimization.” The generated JSON for `certSize` is no longer compatible with consumers that expect a stable, plain numeric value, causing parsing failures or incorrect `certSize` values when reading back `generalInfo`. In addition, `ParseDlpGeneralInfo` incorrectly handles the `offlineAccessFlag` field by failing validation when the key is present but not in the expected boolean form, leading to unexpected `DLP_PARSE_ERROR_VALUE_INVALID` results. These issues break interoperability between components that exchange DLP general info and can prevent DLP files from being generated/parsed reliably. The behavior should be covered by unit tests to ensure `certSize` and related metadata round-trip correctly and invalid inputs are rejected consistently.

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
