**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the reported **bug** in MindSpore related to non-blocking `MoveTo` execution ordering, focusing on the relevant files listed below, and add regression tests.

**Repo Link:**
[https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore)

**Problem Statement:**
This is a **/kind bug** PR. 
When the **`MoveTo` operator** is configured with **`blocking=false`** (non-blocking/async), and its downstream user includes **`AlltoAllv`**, the framework may **fail to guarantee the correct execution order**, which can lead to incorrect behavior. Add **validation** to detect unsafe/non-deterministic execution ordering in this scenario, and ensure the system either enforces or rejects invalid graphs appropriately. 

Add **system test (ST)** coverage for the two scenarios described in the PR: 

1. Without explicitly fixing the execution order among **async MoveTo**, **NonZero**, and **AlltoAllv** → validation should **fail** with clear error logs.
2. With **Depend** (or an equivalent mechanism) used to fix the execution order → validation should **pass**, with expected logs indicating the ordering/validation behavior.

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `mindspore/ccsrc/plugin/ascend/graph_optimizer/stream_assign/` (Ascend stream assignment / execution-order related logic) 
* `tests/st/auto_parallel/` (add/extend ST cases for async MoveTo + AlltoAllv ordering/validation)

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
