**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Implement the requested refactor and test updates described in the PR issue, focusing on the relevant files listed below.

**Repo Link:**
[https://gitee.com/chinabugotech/hutool](https://gitee.com/chinabugotech/hutool) 

**Problem Statement:**
Update the codebase so that **`PredicateUtil` is implemented using `StreamUtil`** (i.e., refactor/rewire logic to reuse Stream utilities rather than duplicating stream-handling behavior). 

Additionally:

* **Complete/expand unit tests** for the affected functionality (add missing test coverage and ensure tests validate expected behavior).
* **Suppress generic-parameter warnings** where appropriate (e.g., address compiler warnings related to raw types / unchecked generics in a minimal and idiomatic way).

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `hutool-core/src/main/java/**/core/func/PredicateUtil.java` 
* `hutool-core/src/main/java/**/core/stream/StreamUtil.java` 
* `hutool-core/src/test/java/**/PredicateUtilTest.java` *(or the closest existing test class covering PredicateUtil / functional utilities)*
* Any shared test helpers or related utility classes touched by the refactor

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
