**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the API behavior described in the PR, focusing on the relevant files listed below, and add/adjust tests.

**Repo Link:**
[https://gitee.com/ascend/triton-ascend](https://gitee.com/ascend/triton-ascend) 

**Problem Statement:**
There is an API bug in the Triton-Ascend Python API mapping: **`tl.flip` should map to `libdevice.flip`** (instead of an incorrect mapping or behavior). Update the implementation so that calling `tl.flip` routes to the correct underlying libdevice operation, consistent with expected semantics. 

Add or adjust unit tests to cover this behavior and prevent regressions.

**Relevant files to update (non-exhaustive but recommended focus):**

* `triton_patch/python/triton_patch/language/standard.py`
* `ascend/examples/pytest_ut/test_flip.py`

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
