**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the described API/type-support issue in the repository and add/adjust tests to prevent regressions.

**Repo Link:**
[https://gitee.com/ascend/triton-ascend](https://gitee.com/ascend/triton-ascend)

**Problem Statement:**
`umulhi` (high-half unsigned multiply) currently does not permit **`uint32`** as an input dtype in the Triton-Ascend language layer, which blocks use cases such as **dropout** in downstream projects (e.g., flaggems). Update the language/API implementation so that `umulhi` properly supports `uint32` inputs in addition to existing supported dtypes, while keeping semantics consistent with the operation definition.

Add or update tests to ensure:

* `umulhi` accepts `uint32` and behaves correctly for representative inputs.
* Any impacted higher-level functionality (e.g., random/dropout-related kernels that rely on `umulhi`) is covered enough to catch regressions.

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
