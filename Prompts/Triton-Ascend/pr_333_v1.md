**Task:**
You are an automated coding agent. Fix the described issue in Triton-Ascend so that the compiler/runtime handles the specified `load/store` case correctly, and add/adjust tests accordingly.

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, when a `load/store` pointer is a **raw/original input parameter** (i.e., not derived via pointer arithmetic) and **no offset is involved**, `tts.load/tts.store` may treat memory access incorrectly (e.g., scalar handling based on pointer semantics). Update the implementation so that, in this scenario, `tts.load/tts.store` correctly performs scalar load/store behavior based on the pointer. 

Add or update test coverage to ensure this scalar-from-original-pointer case is exercised and remains correct. 

**Deliverable:**
Generate a standard **git-style patch file** (unified diff, i.e., .patch file) that implements the feature and adds/updates the necessary tests.
